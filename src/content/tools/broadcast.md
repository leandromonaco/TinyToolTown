Broadcast routes individual application audio streams through DeepFilterNet AI noise suppression on Linux. Instead of filtering everything or nothing, you pick which apps get cleaned up — Discord and browser calls get noise-free audio while Spotify and games stay untouched.

Built it because every Linux noise suppression tool is all-or-nothing. I wanted typing noise gone from video calls without mangling my music. It runs on CPU (~3% of one core), so your GPU stays free.

Ships as three tiny Rust binaries: a shared library, a CLI for scripting/keybinds, and a GTK4+Libadwaita GUI for toggling per-app routing. Real-time stream detection via PipeWire monitoring, persistent per-app preferences, and one-click toggle from your status bar.
