Developers accumulate zombie dev servers — Node, .NET, Python, PHP, Vite, and others — that occupy ports and cause conflicts. DevKill auto-discovers these processes, shows them in a modern dark UI, and lets you kill them individually or in bulk.

I build it, because especially when working with AI agents that start servers in the background, they don't always shut them back down.
