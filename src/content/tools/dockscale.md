If you use a laptop with external monitors, you probably want different display scaling for each setup — higher scaling when docked (to match the external monitors' density) and lower when undocked. Windows doesn't do this automatically, so you end up manually adjusting the scale every time you plug or unplug.

This tool does it for you.

- **External monitors connected** → laptop display scales to **125%** (configurable)
- **No external monitors** → laptop display scales to **100%** (configurable)
