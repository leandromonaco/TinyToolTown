When you type a bash/Linux command in PowerShell 7 that doesn't exist (like `rm -rf`, `grep`, `curl`), PSCommandHelper intercepts it and shows you the PowerShell equivalent with a colorful, educational explanation.

I built it because I kept Googling "PowerShell equivalent of grep" every single time. Instead of just aliasing everything, I wanted something that helps me actually *learn* PowerShell. It hooks into PS7's CommandNotFoundAction — completely non-invasive, educational only (it shows the suggestion but doesn't auto-run anything).

75+ bash-to-PowerShell mappings covering file ops, text processing, system commands, networking, and more. Plus a `Get-CommandMapping` command to browse and search all mappings proactively.
