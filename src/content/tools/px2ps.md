PX2PS reads Pixquare .px files, decompresses the zlib-encoded layer data, composites multiple layers if present, and renders the final image using Unicode lower half block characters (▄) with ANSI True Color escape sequences. Each terminal line represents two rows of pixels. It can also output a .ps1 script version of the output for easy sharing!
