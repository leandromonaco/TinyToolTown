Squeeze is a browser-based video compressor. You set a target file size (like 9MB), drop a video, and it gives you back a compressed file that fits under your limit. That's it.
                                                                                                                  
  What it does:                                                                                                   
  - Calculates the exact bitrate needed to hit your target size                                                   
  - Auto-downscales resolution when the bitrate is too low for the source resolution (no point keeping 4K if you  
  only have 500kbps to work with)
  - Two-pass encoding so it spends bits wisely — more on complex scenes, less on simple ones
  - Shows real-time progress with an ETA

  Why it's delightful:
  - Zero friction — no install, no account, no upload. Drop a file, get a result.
  - Private by default — everything runs in-browser via FFmpeg WASM. Your video never leaves your machine. No sketchy "free video compressor" sites.
  - It solves a real, annoying problem — every platform has upload limits (Streamyard's 9MB, Discord's 10MB, email attachments). Instead of guessing at HandBrake settings or Googling "ffmpeg bitrate calculator," you just type the number you need.
  - It's a single HTML file — the entire app. No build step, no dependencies to install, no framework. View source and you see everything.
  - It's smart about quality — lanczos downscaling, two-pass encoding, and automatic resolution selection mean you get the best possible quality for your size budget without touching a single setting.
