I've been running all my infra in AWS and last week I started just asking claude code to provision, manage and configure a lot of it. The issue I ran into was that claude code needed permissions for all sorts of things and I was constantly adding, removing or editing IAM policies by hand in my AWS Account which quickly became tedious.

Also I ended up with a bunch of IAM policies and all sorts of permissions granted to my user that it was a mess.

So I built an MCP server that sits between AWS STS (Security Token Service) and allows Claude code to ask for temporary AWS Credentials with scoped permissions to a specific service. After a fixed amount of time the credentials expire and all my AWS Accounts now have zero IAM policies.
